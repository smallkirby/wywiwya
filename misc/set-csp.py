#
# Generated distribution files of Nuxt, SPA mode contains inline script inside its 200.html.
# Therefore, it must have nonce attribute for Content-Security-Policy (CSP) to work.
# This script add meta tag of CSP and add nonce to 200.html.
#
# This mitigation's purpose is just to "raise a bar".
# Cuz nonce is completely static, it has no guard agains script tag with the same static nonce.
# However, it at least would be a mitigation of javascript directive and so on.
#
# Other mitigations for XSS is held such as DOMPurify, iframe sandbox, and etc.
